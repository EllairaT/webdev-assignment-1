                    <p> I had a little bit of trouble with figuring out how to store multiple permissions
                        while still following Database normalization rules (for 1NF: the value of each attribute is atomic). I couldn't just put all 3 permissions in one 
                        cell with a comma separating them as that would be bad practice.
                    </p>
                    <p> I had the most trouble with figuring out how CSS specificity works. 
                        This was the first time I've had to think about specificity because to edit bootstrap elements, I need to 
                        be very, very specific with the selectors. 

                    </p>
