                    <p> I had a little bit of trouble with figuring out how to store multiple permissions
                        while still following Database normalization rules (for 1NF: the value of each attribute is atomic). I couldn't just put all 3 permissions in one 
                        cell with a comma separating them as that would be bad practice.
