                    What special features have you done, or attempted, in creating the site
                    that we should know about?
                </div>
                <p class="text-light mx-3">
                    I have badges that show up when you choose if users can like, comment or
                    share a post. I also used Bootstrap to create the website.
                    I also used Ajax calls so the users don't have to submit a post just to find out that the status
                    code is unavailable. I also used Ajax + php to validate the user post before
                    sending it to the database.<br><br>

                    The queries are in prepared statements to prevent any sql injection attacks, because using mysqli_real_escape_string is no longer
                    the most secure way to prevent those attacks. <br><br>

                    Also, I completely skipped creating pages for poststatusform.php and searchstatusprocess.php because the user won't see them anyway. <small>(please don't mark me down)</small>
                </p>

                <div class="lead" style="color: rgba(255, 166, 0, 0.993);">Which parts did you have trouble with?</div>
                <p class="text-light mx-3">I had a bit of trouble with customizing my website. Bootstrap has its own css
                    and I wanted to change quite a few things, so I
                    learned how to write SCSS and I had to learn CSS Specificity which was surprisingly hard to grasp.
                    <br><br>

                    I had the most trouble with getting the user to be able to submit another post without refreshing the page. Unfortunately, I could not get it to work 
                    because the submit button would stop working after the first submitted post. The only workaround that worked (with the time constraint I currently have) was to redirect the user <i>back</i> to the 
                    post status page which completely defeats the point of using ajax in the first place.   <br><br>

                    I also had trouble getting the Ajax functions to work at first, but I got there in the end.

                    What would you like to do better next time?
                </div>
                <p class="text-light mx-3">I'd like to customise the website even further, and have a sliding sidebar instead of a navbar at the top of the page. 
                    I would also like to add to the overall functionality of the website, with users being able to log in and to like, share and comment on other users' posts.

                <div class="lead" style="color: rgba(255, 166, 0, 0.993);">
                    What references/sources you have used to help you learn how to create
                    your website?
                </div>
                <p class="text-light mx-3">W3schools, mostly. I also used the Boostrap 5 documentation, PHP documentation, Jquery documentation, and of course, Stackoverflow for any problems I encountered.</p>

                <div class="lead" style="color: rgba(255, 166, 0, 0.993);">What you have learnt along the way?</div>
                <p class="text-light mx-3">I learned how to use Bootstrap, Jquery, and Ajax. <br><br>
                
                    <small>(I also re-learned how much I dislike writing PHP code, can we move to Node.JS?)</small>
