                            while still following Database normalization rules (for 1NF: the value of each attribute is
                            atomic). I couldn't just put all 3 permissions in one
                            cell with a comma separating them as that would be bad practice.

                        <p> I had the most trouble with figuring out how CSS specificity works.
                            This was the first time I've had to think about specificity because to edit bootstrap
                            elements, I need to
                            be very, very specific with the selectors.
